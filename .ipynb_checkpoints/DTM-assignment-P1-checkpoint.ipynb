Make sure you save your work and submit your assignment on Blackboard before the deadline. You will work together with your team members, but you are not allowed to consult with other teams. The assignments will be checked for plagiarism, so please make sure that your submitted work is clearly your own.\n",

    "1. Your Notebook containing all your code, which should run without error messages. Please make sure to use comments throughout your code to explain what each piece of code is doing. Undocumented blocks of code will not receive points. Your code will also be evaluated with regards to how effective it is in applying the appropriate Python techniques (e.g., is the code using the right data structures, etc.). The readability of your code, output, and comments will also be considered. This means that not all code with the correct output will necessarily receive the full number of points.\n",

    "2. A short report (2-3 pages, in Word or PDF) summarizing for each question what the main challenges were for your team in accomplishing the task, how you came to the solution, and what the results were. At the end of your report write down how tasks were divided (who did what), and briefly describe how you worked together as a team.\n",

    "For this assignment you will search for spelling variants in a word list from a made-up language, which we will refer to as 'historic Martian'. Spelling rules didn't exist on Mars in the 13th century, and documents from that period therefore contain a large amount of spelling variation. The word *ducovum* ('mountain'), for example, has the historic variants *ducovum*, *ducouvum*, and *ducouvu*. The goal of this assignment is to find historic spelling variants of modern Martian words. The data is provided on Blackboard in the file \"historicMartian.txt\". Make sure to download this file from Blackboard and save it in the same folder as this Notebook.\n",
